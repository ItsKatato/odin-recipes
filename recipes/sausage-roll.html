        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sausage French Toast Roll-Ups are a delicious breakfast option that combines the best of both savory and sweet flavors.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, or brioche)</li>
            <li>8 sausage links (pork, turkey, or vegetarian)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
            <li>Butter for frying</li>
            <li>Maple syrup or powdered sugar for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Start by cooking the sausage links in a skillet over medium heat until fully cooked. If you prefer a healthier option, try using turkey or vegetarian sausage. Once cooked, set the sausages aside and allow them to cool slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Prep:</strong> In a shallow bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. This mixture will coat the bread and give the roll-ups their signature French toast flavor. </li>
            <li><strong>Roll:</strong> Trim the crusts from the bread slices to make rolling easier. Using a rolling pin, flatten each slice of bread. Place a cooked sausage link on one end of each slice and roll tightly. Make sure to seal the roll-ups by gently pressing the seam side down. </li>
            <li><strong>Dip and Cook:</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of butter. Dip each roll-up into the French toast batter, making sure it is fully coated. Place the roll-ups seam-side down in the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once cooked, serve the Sausage French Toast Roll-Ups with a drizzle of maple syrup or a dusting of powdered sugar. You can also add fresh fruit or whipped cream for extra indulgence. For a savory twist, sprinkle with a bit of shredded cheese.
