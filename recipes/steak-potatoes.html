        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A very easy dinner with simple ingredients</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ Butter</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 lb Yukon Gold Potatoes, cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
            <li>3 Garlic Cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Dried Thyme</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Dried Oregano</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Sea Salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ¼ lb Sirloin Steak, cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil and two tablespoons of the ghee to the pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the potatoes:</strong> Once the ghee is melted, add the potatoes and sprinkle the garlic, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper over top of the potatoes in the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes before stirring the potatoes. Stir the potatoes and cook until they are golden brown and fork tender, about 6-8 minutes. Stir frequently, about every minute, to prevent sticking. Remove the potatoes and the browned bits from the pan and set aside. </li>
            <li><strong>Sear the steak:</strong> Increase the heat to medium-high and add the remaining two tablespoons of ghee to the pan. Once melted, add the steak pieces and season with a dash of salt and pepper. Cook for at least 2 minutes before stirring the steak pieces. You want to make sure you get a good sear on them. Stir and continue to cook until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. </li>
            <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Add the potatoes back to the pan and stir to combine. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Top with freshly chopped parsley. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
